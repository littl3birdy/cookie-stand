# Salmon Cookies


## Assignment from Codefellows :
Your friend Pat has come up with a business idea by combining two signature Seattle icons: Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies are made into the shape of a salmon and have just a hint of fishy goodness.

Pat needs some help with the branding of the business, as well as some help with internal data management for the company, and has enlisted your assistance because of your extensive and proven work in developing web applications.

## Develop a web app that does the following:
* Calculate the number of cookies that each location needs to bake each day so that Pat can manage inventory and baking schedules. The number of cookies needed depends on the hours open for each location, the minimum number of customers per hour, the maximum number of customers per hour and the average number of cookies purchased per customer.

* The application needs to be adaptable, in case Pat adds or sells stores in the future. Pat also needs to be able to easily modify the average sales numbers based on his daily sales.

* Pat needs a public-facing page. He has provided a logo image but is requesting your assistance in the design of the documents, color scheme, fonts, and any additional images for the public facing site.
