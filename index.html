      <h3>Fishy Goodness for Everyone!</h3>
      <p class="pat">Pat has been making these delicious confections for his family for the last 5 years, and has finally decided to share this fishy goodness with the rest of the world!</p>
      <p class="pat"> Each of our handcrafted cookies starts with Wild Alaskan salmon caught at the peak of the season in Bristol Bay.  Pat has a contract with a privately owned fishing company that uses sustainable fishing techniques so you can feel good about your fishy cookies. Flour, sugar, butter, salmon, frosting and a whole lotta love make for a delectable treat that can't be beat!</p>
